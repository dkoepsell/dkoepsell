# David R. Koepsell

Philosopher of law, ethics, and technology | Builder of formal ontologies, simulations, and narrative systems

I work at the intersection of **legal ontology, relational ethics, and computational modeling**. My projects combine philosophical theory with executable structures: ontologies, simulations, tools, and narrative systems that make abstract claims testable, explorable, and teachable.

This GitHub is where those ideas become *things that run*.

## Core Research Trajectory

My work forms a unified research program sometimes referred to as **The Architecture of Social Being**, developed across several major strands:

### 🧭 Relational Ethics
**The Geometry of the Good**  
A structural ontology of ethics that models obligation, trust, contradiction, and repair as *relational facts*, rather than norms, preferences, or commands. Ethical failure generates residue and repair obligations, which can be simulated and measured.

### ⚖️ Legal Ontology
**The Architecture of Justice** and **A Structural Ontology of the Law**  
A realist, BFO-aligned account of legal systems that treats law as a structured network of roles, relations, contradictions, and institutional repair mechanisms. This work informs legal AI, IRAC-style reasoning tools, and formal legal modeling.

### 🤖 Ethics, AI, and Agency
A non-voluntarist account of agency grounded in **counterfactual accountability** and exposure to irreversible relations. This framework applies to humans, institutions, AIs, DAOs, and hybrid systems, and rejects intention or consciousness as necessary conditions for moral agency.

## Active & Representative Projects

### 🔬 SimEthica
Agent-based simulation framework for testing ethical and ontological hypotheses.

- Models obligation issuance, fulfillment, denial, expiration, and repair
- Tracks contradiction debt, trust, moral energy, and epistemic agency
- Exports CSV data for empirical analysis
- Used to test claims from *The Geometry of the Good*

> Ethical theory, but falsifiable.

---

### ⚖️ Structural Ontology of Law (SOoL)
Formal ontology modules aligned with Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).

- Role complexes (judge, defendant, institution)
- Legal events, obligations, breaches, and repairs
- Minimum Legal Chain (MLC) modeling
- OWL / TTL / UML / PlantUML representations

Designed for legal reasoning systems, research, and pedagogy.

---

### 🧠 IRACplus
A structural legal reasoning tool for students and researchers.

- Extends IRAC into an ontological pipeline
- Diagnoses contradictions and missing links
- Outputs structured JSON representations of legal reasoning
- Intended for law students, legal educators, and legal AI research

---

### 🎲 CAML & Everdice
Narrative and structural tooling for tabletop RPGs and interactive storytelling.

- **CAML (Canonical Adventure Modeling Language)**  
  A structured format for encoding narrative possibilities without railroading.

- **CAML-Trace**  
  Forensic and replayable traces of narrative decision paths.

- **Everdice Realm**  
  A DM-respecting campaign assistant focused on long-form coherence, trust, and player agency.

These projects double as experimental sandboxes for agency, obligation, and narrative structure.

---

## What Ties This Together

Across philosophy, law, ethics, and games, the core commitments are the same:

- Structure matters more than intention
- Obligation arises from relations, not rules
- Failure produces residue that must be repaired
- Agency is earned through accountability, not asserted
- Pluralism is not a problem to eliminate, but a condition to manage

If something cannot be modeled, traced, or tested, I treat that as a philosophical warning sign.

---

## Teaching & Public Work

I use these tools and frameworks in undergraduate and graduate teaching, especially in:

- Legal ontology
- Philosophy of law
- Ethics of technology
- Moral psychology
- AI and responsibility

Many repositories here double as teaching infrastructure.

---

## Status

This is an active, evolving research ecosystem. Some repositories are experimental, some pedagogical, some production-ready. All are part of a single long-term project.

If you're a philosopher, legal scholar, developer, or designer interested in **making normative and institutional theory executable**, you’re in the right place.
